# Simon-game
Simon is a classic electronic game from the 1980s, and remains a popular choice for those who love a good memory challenge. Here, you can play the Simon game right in your browser, and test your memory skills against the computer.

To get started, simply click on the link provided in the description section of this repository button and watch as the game lights up a sequence of colors and sounds. Your task is to repeat the sequence back in the correct order - but be careful, because the sequence gets longer and more complex with each round!

Learning Outcomes of this project will definitely be everlasting
